CHANGE sample code to have html comment

make the gradient syntax lines not wrapper.

My opinion "unofficially"

- 3 implementations following spec.

Past timeline - less emphasis on how long it takes. 

what happened in between (why it happens, and what is being done to change it). 

visually show how the thing took place for each spec.

Individual action: 
- after the timeline thing
- and during those years there were people outside the working group bringing feedback to the mailing list. 
- personal nature of contribution
- you can make everything better

- State the ideal outcome at the beginning rather than at the end.
- Smoother transition between Doctype to Flexbox side. 


- Conformance slide was confusing producer â‰  producer

- Summarize how to participate at the end

- W3C -> names of the Working Groups how the stuff is partitioned

- How Working Groups get created

- Who bestowed this authority on W3C to begin with.

- Explain Working Draft vs Editor's Draft.

- Continue the personal story into working at Opera and now Adobe.

- Trade off some of the stuff to do, to maintain the engaging personal story line. 

- make the code bigger for Quirks mode.

- segues seem abrupt (the why and then the specs)

- How did I find out the specifications

- Working Groups - it could be something we can add funny images.

- Community Groups - mention that to people (everyone can enter) 

- Trolling - funny image

- Work on the speed. Cut content down.

- Mailing lists provide full email address

- talk more about the frustrations and specific frustrations. what are the other things people get frustrated with and this will help them with. this x thing i cant use on mozilla, things that are prefixe etc etc

FEEDBACK FROM LEA
- gradients should be same values
- make the opacity 0 or less 
- Use UA instead of consumers/producers
- step 64: Bigger font size, smaller text needed
- step 66: highlight numbers so people can notice.
- step-73: Since this will be up on a projector, they won't be able to click the link. Maybe add the url somewhere too?
- step-91: too much text on the slide
- also "Writing more better tests" sounds grammatically incorrect. Maybe "writing better tests" or "writing more and better tests"

FEEDBACK FROM MARC:
* (for later - maybe a blog post?) Make a checklist of all the to do items goodness
* Highlight discussion session in spec screenshot
* Move twitter people to the end of the presentation - just mention that they are at the end during the preso.
* Outcomes
** Vocal feedback on features you want - how - be specific?
** Providing polyfills was only briefly touched on.  you may want to talk about this more or drop it.
* Should we remind people the best way to help is come up with actual code and use cases? the groups are filled with coding-academics talking about academic things. something from real users/designers/coders that show how real users want to use the  features maybe the best help of all(if this is true)
* Something about timing of events throughout the year (WG's, TPAC, etc.) and what happens at them?
* HTML Meetups? Maybe not related.
* Tools about finding out the current state of things? (ie caniuse, movethewebforward, html5rocks)
 
 FEEDBACK FROM ETHAN:
 	"Flex Box" in title, should be "Flexbox", no?
	"less of your peers" => "fewer of your peers"
	"recommendation" => "Recommendation (REC)" ?
	"Show that you have done the work to find a response".  More about an "answer" than a "response".

QUIRKS MODE
- Concrete example of Quirks mode 
- Example of Jquery frameworks concrete example of what would take time to render (evaluate frameworks)
- Participate in Working Group not a member of Working Group
- Trolling: what it is.
- Polyfill: explain what it is.
- Reword CR 2 or more implementations
- CR ->> PR is the time when you need two or more implementation passing the test suites
- Have an illustration of what I talked about on the slide (box-shadow). 
- Adobe Spec example (not flexbox). 
- Mention links to slides

- propose alternatives and propose pros and cons (cite Francois Remy's summary of css variables). 
- Why contribute? (no need to have on slides)
- Show question first and then answer
- One sentence on the intention of the presentation
- Speak slower
- Fix the typo: wat?!
- Too much info for emails. no need to say who these people are. 
- Use fake content to easier to read
- Zoom into slides.
- Say the changes are 'hard' after CR
- If you follow these guidelines you can get a response.

- Pushing the web forward through standards - it was not obvious it is about standards. 
- Examples of how it is getting better: Talk about CSS Regions how it is so fast, specs from Googlee tc how it is getting better.
